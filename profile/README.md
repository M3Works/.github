[M3 Works](m3works.io) is continually developing the next generation of
physically snow and water resource tools, while supporting geospatial opensource
software. We are the architects of modern iSnobal, applying high resolution
modeling across the Western US. 
We work with open-source technology to make the tools we build and use more broadly accessible. We collaborate with organizations and communities eager to address some of the world's most challenging problems. Take a look at some of our pinned repositories to get a sense of what we do.

## How we model
We run our high resolution snowpack model to support water management decisions
in over 30 basins across the Western US. Our data is near-realtime,
highly validated, and expertly blended with spatial airborne and satellite
data. The backbone of our model is a cloud-native, highly scalable, custom
implementation of the iSnobal snowpack model.


## Opensource for the community
We care deeply about making data access easy and available to the
cryosphere and geospatial communities. We support multiple opensource
software projects to make this possible
